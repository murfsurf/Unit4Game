Week 4 Homework Assignment
After creating the html page, I understand the logic to be as follows:

I. Include the code to generate a random number between 19 and 120

II. Store the randomly generated number in a variable and display the number to the user

IIa. Assign a constant value (number) to each of the crystal buttons.
IIaa. The number assigned to the crystal will be a random generated number between 1 and 12.

III. The user is asked to click one of the crystals displayed
IIIa.  Create a variable to hold the aggregate of user clicks per crystal clicked.

IV. On the "on-click" event, an amount assigned to that particular crystal will be added to a variable created to aggregate
IV. the user's points per click.

V. Compare the user's aggregate value to the value of the randomly generated number that was displayed to the user.
Va. If the result of the comparison is equal, then declare the user "winner" with a message.

Vb. If the result of the comparison is that the user aggregate is less than the random number, then prompt user to click
Vb. a crystal again.
-- Do Va. again

Vc. If the result of the comparison is that the user aggregate is greater than the random number, then prompt user that
Vc. have lost the game and ask if they would like to start a new game.

That is the logic of the game as I understand it.
